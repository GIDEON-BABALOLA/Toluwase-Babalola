" 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business problem: predicting the weekly stock level percentage using customer sales data"+
"2Ô∏è‚É£ Analysing the data: Clean, prepare, and extract relevant features (timestamp, temperature, stock level, product quantity, etc.)."+
"3Ô∏è‚É£ Data modelling and model development: a predictive ML model (random forest regressor) to predict the stock level percentage."+
"4Ô∏è‚É£ Model validation: validate the model's performance using metrics (MAE). presented the findings to the client." +
"5Ô∏è‚É£ Production and quality assurance: deploy the model into an IoT temperature sensor and ensure better quality if the client provides larger data containing more information (delivery time)."+
 "üìä Findings:"+
"- Fruits and vegetables had the highest number of sales, while spices and herbs had the least sales."+
"- The average unit price, quantity, and total money spent on groceries were $7.82, 2.5, and $19.71, respectively."+
"- The number of customers with standard and premium memberships was the same as non-members, while those with basic memberships were the least."+
"- Cash was the most frequent payment method used during that week."+
"- There is a strong correlation (0.79) between the unit price and the total money spent in the store."+
 
"üí° Recommendations:" +
"Based on the developed model, I have drawn some recommendations for optimizing sales and improving customer experience:"+
"1Ô∏è‚É£ To increase sales, consider placing herbs and related items close to fruits and vegetables."+
"2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring additional features and data will enhance the digitization of payment methods."+
"3Ô∏è‚É£ Encourage non-members to register for free standard membership, which can boost sales and attract new customers."+
"4Ô∏è‚É£ Consider offering discounts on items that have low sales to influence customers' decisions, potentially attracting new customers and increasing overall sales."
