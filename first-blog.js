module.exports.content = 
"Just concluded an interesting 1-hour session with Ayush Pai, Matt Brown and Akmal Chaudhri, Esq. on an AI Baskethball" 
+ "Referee System With Computer Vision. The SingleStore DB was used as the database platform.Backbone model:" 
+ "YOLOv8 (A VGG 16 CNN was trained with the extracted data)Data Retrieval: Roboflow (about 3,000 images)Ayush"
 + "described that the model is able to detect real-time pose estimation such as dribbling, travelling and fouls in basketball."
  + "Also, it would rapidly identify ignored violations like double dribbling (steps, count and hold) and bias, aimed to improve"
  + "refereeing and transparency during the game.I am looking forward to how the applications of this system could be used to improve"
 + "detection and monitoring in other sports and health sectors.Thanks to Ayush, Matt, Akmal and SingleStore's team for this innovative experience and showcase."
